What are types of power ?\nthe main types you know as mechanical engineer are ** electric power and mechanical power**\n$$\nelectric: power = I : V\n$$\n$$\nMechanical ; power = F ; V\n$$\nnote that for mechanical power it could be \\(F ; V\\) if the velocity is linear or \\(T ; omega\\) if the velocity is angular .\nBut we will talk mainly on Fluid Power in this term.\n\n# BONUS\n\n\nFluid Power is equal to what ? \n\n\n\nit’s pressure  flowrate,* or \\(P*Q\\).\n\n\n\n\n\\(P*V\\), is Flow Energy, where \\(P\\) is pressure and \\(V\\) is volume, note that dividing energy by time gives you power, \\(dfrac{V}{t}=Q\\).\n\n\n** Take Care …!! **\n\n# BONUS\n\nWhat are the units of :\n\n\nelectric power (\\(I; *V\\)) \\(rightarrow\\) ” \\(M.L^2.T^{-3}\\) “.\n\n\n\n\nmechanical power (\\(F ; *V\\) or \\(T* ; omega\\)) \\(rightarrow\\) ” \\(M.L^2.T^{-3}\\) “.\n\n\n\n\nfluid power (\\(P*Q\\)) \\(rightarrow\\) ” \\(M.L^2.T^{-3}\\) “. ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nall of them have the same units which is watts, or any units with the same dimentions as watts, they only differs up to the conversion factor from one unit to another with the same dimention ” \\(M.L^2.T^{-3}\\) “.\n\n\n\n\nin SI mechanical horse power (english or french) = 745.7 watts (SI),\n\n\n\n\nwatt = one joule per second\n\n\n\n\njoule = \\(kg.m^2.s^-2\\)\n\n\n\n# BONUS\n\n\nwhy fluid power system ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe fluid power system cannot increase power it controls power with increase of force and decrease velocity, according to conservation of energy it transforms mechnical energy with some losses to mechanical energy with tourque or force magnification.\n\n\n\n\ncontrol fluid power (\\(P ;and; Q\\)).\n\n\n\n\nfor electric power its limited in high power.\n\n\n\n\nfor fluid power we can control high power as wel as low power.\n\n\n\n\nfor transmission of power electric is prefered.\n\n\n\n\nwe control the tourque or force via pressurized fluid.\n\n\n\n\npump transform mechanical to hydraulic power and valves for control\n\n\n\n\npressure scaler\n\n\n\n\n\\(Q\\) vector so we control value and direction.\n\n\n\n\nthen reconvert fluid power to mechnical power again via actuator.\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n\n    A[mech] --> | pump conv to| B[fluid]\n\n    B[fluid] --> |actuator conv to| A[mech]\n\n\n# BONUS\n\n\nthe main disadvantage of oil in fluid power system ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe main problem is flamability, hygenic (النظافة كل الادوية نيوماتيك) and viscosity change with temprature\n\n\n\n\ndentist use penumatic system due to hygenic and very high number of turns he needs."
